//
use cards for abilities
maybe random
or buying them

but the gist of is that you can use cards and then abilities will activate with a sick animation ant effect
one time use abilities on top of the default ones
or perma that last 10 sec or so

you draw them from a deck
or you buy them in a shop and have certain ones

or you buy them and the get drawn randomly from a deck
